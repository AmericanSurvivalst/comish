    <div class="article-content">
        <p>I'm a sales rep. Not a developer. Not a startup founder. Just a guy who got tired of not knowing what his paycheck would be until it hit his bank account.</p>
        
        <p>This is the story of why I built Comish.</p>

        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        
        <p>Every sales rep I know has the same complaint: comp plans are complicated and nobody tells you what you're actually getting paid until it's too late to do anything about it.</p>
        
        <p>My company uses tiered commission. First $375K at 6%, next tier at 8%, then 10%, then 12%. Sounds simple enough until you try to calculate what happens when a $50K deal pushes you from one tier to the next mid-quarter.</p>
        
        <p>Part of that deal gets paid at the old rate. Part at the new rate. The math isn't hard, but it's tedious. And if you're tracking 15-20 deals per quarter across multiple tiers with different rates for 1-year vs 2-year contracts? Your spreadsheet becomes a nightmare.</p>

        <h2>The Spreadsheet Phase</h2>
        
        <p>Like every rep, I started with Excel. Built a beautiful sheet with color-coded tiers and conditional formatting. Even had a little progress bar toward my quarterly goal.</p>
        
        <p>It lasted three months before the first major error. I'd hardcoded the tier thresholds from the previous year. Didn't notice until my paycheck was almost a thousand dollars short.</p>
        
        <p>HR fixed it, but I realized something: I was spending hours every month maintaining a system that still failed me when it mattered.</p>

        <h2>Looking for Solutions</h2>
        
        <p>So I went looking for tools. What I found was either:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Enterprise software</strong> (CaptivateIQ, Spiff, etc.) - Costs $30-50 per user per month, requires company buy-in, IT implementation, and months of setup. Great for companies, useless for individual reps.</li>
            <li><strong>More spreadsheet templates</strong> - Same problems I already had, just with someone else's formatting.</li>
            <li><strong>Nothing</strong> - Seriously, there was no tool built for individual reps who just want to track their own commission.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Every solution assumed you were a sales ops manager buying for a team. Nobody was building for the rep.</p>

        <h2>Building It Myself</h2>
        
        <p>I'm not a developer, but I know enough to be dangerous. Started learning to code on nights and weekends. Built the first version in a couple months—ugly as hell but functional.</p>
        
        <p>The core logic was simple: set your tier thresholds once, log your deals, and let the math handle itself. No formulas to maintain. No quarterly template copying. Just accurate commission calculations.</p>
        
        <p>I used it for a full quarter. Caught two errors in my company's commission statements that I would have missed with my spreadsheet. That's when I knew this thing had legs.</p>

        <h2>Why $5/Month</h2>
        
        <p>When I decided to share it, the pricing question came up immediately. Enterprise tools charge $30-50 per user. I could probably get away with $20.</p>
        
        <p>But here's the thing: I built this because I was frustrated that nothing affordable existed. Charging $20/month would make me part of the same problem.</p>
        
        <p>$5/month is the price of a fancy coffee. It's low enough that any rep can expense it (or just pay it without thinking). It's high enough to cover server costs and show that it's a real product, not some abandoned side project.</p>
        
        <blockquote>Sales reps shouldn't have to spend a fortune to know what they're getting paid.</blockquote>

        <h2>What It Does (And Doesn't Do)</h2>
        
        <p>Comish is intentionally simple. It does a few things really well:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Tiered commission calculations that actually work</li>
            <li>Different rates for 1-year vs 2-year contracts</li>
            <li>Quarterly goal tracking with attainment percentages</li>
            <li>PDF and CSV exports for taxes or checking your employer's math</li>
            <li>Separate mode for SDR/BDR activity-based comp</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>It doesn't integrate with Salesforce. It doesn't have team dashboards. It doesn't do forecasting or pipeline management. Those features would push the price up and the complexity through the roof.</p>
        
        <p>This is a tool for tracking commission. That's it. And it does that job extremely well.</p>

        <h2>The Goal</h2>
        
        <p>I want every sales rep to know exactly what they're getting paid before their paycheck hits. Not approximately. Not "I think it's around X." The exact number.</p>
        
        <p>When you close a deal, you should know immediately how much commission you just earned. When you're pushing at end of quarter, you should see in real-time how close you are to the next tier.</p>
        
        <p>That's what Comish does. Nothing more, nothing less.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box accent">
            <p>I still use Comish every day for my own deals. If you're a rep who's tired of spreadsheet hell, give it a try. 14-day free trial, no credit card required. And if it doesn't work for your comp plan, email me—I might just build the feature you need.</p>
